An "Asteroids"-like game with a twist: input has to be done in sync with a song while the physics run non-stop.

WARNING: THIS PROTOTYPE CONTAINS FLASHING LIGHTS, WITH NO OPTION (YET!!) TO DEACTIVATE THEM. **PLEASE DO NOT PLAY IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING LIGHTS!!** (I'm sorry, I'll change it as soon as I start taking care of accessibility options!!)

Controls:

Up-arrow: impulse forwards

Down-arrow: impulse backwards

Left-arrow: rotate left

Right-arrow: rotate right

X: shoot

Z: switch gun
